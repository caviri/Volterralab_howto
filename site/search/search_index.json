Two of them are physically in the room and we count with a wireframe at UNIL computing facilities (NAS). To use the computer remotely go to \"How to conect?\" tutorial. Don't shut down the computer, disconect your session when your work is over Computing Servers dnfvoltdatasrv1.ad.unil.ch IP : 130.223.196.101 CPU : 48 Cores RAM : 1 TB Graphic card : Radeon WX7100 Storage : 2TB SDD Software : Imaris 8.4.2/Imaris 9.1.2/Matlab R2015b-R2018/ImageJ Frequent users : Cedric, Iaroslav and Carlos dnfvoltdatasrv2.ad.unil.ch IP : 130.223.196.100 CPU : 16 Cores RAM : 764GB Graphic card : Radeon WX7100 Storage : 6TB SSD and: Iaroslav Disk 625GB Other Disk 600GB Software : Imaris 8.4.2/Matlab/ImageJ/LLastik/Blender Frequent users : Barbara and Iaroslav dnfvoltdatasrv3.ad.unil.ch (Not available yet) We are going to configure a computing server based in Ubuntu. We are going to use it mainly for non-graphical computational tasks that will be send to the server through a password secured ssh connection using the slurm workload manager. CPU : 48 Cores RAM : 1TB OS : Ubuntu 18.04 Graphic card : Quadro P5000 Storage : 2TB SSD Software : Python2/Python3/R/Matlab/Ruby/Julia/ Frequent users : Slurm is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. And it will manage all the tools and taks that are sent to the computer Every task performed will be explicitly defined. (It will be possible to replicate any analysis easily) The performance of the machine will be higher than in Windows It will be possible to use GPU-computing Multiple users could sent the task to compute and if some error appear it will be logged in a file. It secure as Windows server non-graphical interface doesn\u2019t mean that you are not going to have graphical inputs or outputs. It means that the computational task is going to be follow through the console. This kind of systems are implemented in every bioinformatic lab and are standard ways to analyse the data, so engineers, physicist and computational biologists could it be familiar with it. May it be that the members of the team require some training in how to use properly but it something affordable that I can organise. This diversification of our IT resources will provide us the best of every system. Relevant points The authorship of this points belongs to Y. Savchuk. Do not shutdown these machines. Please do not restart these machines if other users are still connected, without asking! Volterra NAS can be accessed natively by mapping \\nas-fbm-av1.unil.ch\\AV_NAS_PRIVATE to a disk letter (e.g. Z: , see picture below). Use \\nas.unil.ch for the UNIL NAS. Use can also directly type these into the Explorer address bar. For fastest connection (especially from home), use the lowest color depth setting for Remote Desktop settings (High Color 15-bit setting). If you have a High-DPI screen (such as 3200 x 1800, common on modern laptops), you will also get much better speed by reducing your display screen resolution to e.g. 1920 x 1080 before connecting. Already installed are: Matlab R2016a, ImageJ, and Imaris 8.4 and 9.0. Imaris 9.0 is only working on dnfvoltdatasrv1 (but there is a limit on UNIL licenses, so best to try in the morning before everyone arrives). If you do not get a license, you can also use 8.4 on dnfvoltdatasrv2 (license is always available for the moment) Try to avoid saving your documents to the local C: drive (i.e. your Desktop, My Documents, etc.). Please use NAS or your external drives instead. We only have 1 TB capacity for C: , so it will fill up fast. To attach an external USB drive, you will have to physically access the machine and plug your disk into one of the USB ports. When you are done, please \u201cSign out\u201d instead of disconnecting (see below how to do that). Since the RAM and video card are shared, please close the programs you do not use, particularly Imaris. One important trick is to minimize the Imaris windows if you leave them open for a long time: there is a bug where the video RAM will keep getting eaten up over time, leading to a crash, unless the window is minimized. You can view total RAM consumption through the Task manager, as well as check how much is in use by the other users (see below) To connect from home, use Pulse Secure first to get onto UNIL network. Please make sure your personal computer is virus-free. If you have old accounts on the dnfvoltdatasrv2 machine, these can still be used The machines will be restarted weekly on Saturday nice in order to install the updates (on Sunday 1 AM, actually). If this is not OK for you (running computations, etc), we can postpone the shutdown manually: just get in touch. NAS storage The lab counts with various NAS that offers storage. If you want to connect you can access directly from the explorer address line or in mac from the finder > go to option. Synology To access to the control panel is necesary to have an administration account and access through here http://130.223.30.65:5000/ . Known issues From time to time a backup fail appears. This must be consider normal if only happens sporadically. UNIL NAS This NAS belongs to university and every member of the lab has a PRIVATE folder that could be used. To access to this NAS use this address in windows: \\\\nas.unil.ch\\FBM To access to this NAS use this adress in mac: //nas.unil.ch/FBM Volterra's NAS This NAS is for private use in the laboratory. Every member has a folder on it. IP: 130.334.30.65 10 gigabits (1gb/user) RAID6 Secondary backup per day at 1am with backup explorer. In Sunday it does a parity check. To access to this NAS use this address in windows: \\\\nas-fbm-av1.unil.ch\\AV_NAS_PRIVATE To access to this NAS use this adress in mac: //nas-fbm-av1.unil.ch/AV_NAS_PRIVATE 2018 Upgrade: 28 Disk of 10TB SATA 6GB/s -> 0,28 Petabytes Upgrade made by art computer How to access to a NAS? Windows To connect to NAS, use the link in the information of the webpage. Mac Linux NAS installation on Linux Terminal In Ubuntu is required to install next: sudo apt-get install cifs-utils sudo apt install smbclient and then we could conect using this command using your EMAIL smbclient -U EMAIL //nas-fbm-av1.unil.ch/AV_NAS_PRIVATE If you want to mount the NAS in an specific folder you need to use this command but using the domain of the group ( AD ) and your ID (e.g. cvivarri ) sudo mkdir /media/nas-fbm-av1 sudo mount -o username=ID,domain=AD //nas-fbm-av1.unil.ch/AV_NAS_PRIVATE/ PATH_TO_FOLDER Once this is done you could access to the files through the terminal. Graphical NAS installation on Linux You need to use your ID (e.g. cvivarri), the Group Domain AD , and the link to the NAS smb://nas-fbm-av1.unil.ch How to connect to remote desktop servers?

Savchuk. Do not shutdown these machines. Please do not restart these machines if other users are still connected, without asking! Volterra NAS can be accessed natively by mapping \\nas-fbm-av1.unil.ch\\AV_NAS_PRIVATE to a disk letter (e.g. Z: , see picture below). Use \\nas.unil.ch for the UNIL NAS. Use can also directly type these into the Explorer address bar. For fastest connection (especially from home), use the lowest color depth setting for Remote Desktop settings (High Color 15-bit setting). If you have a High-DPI screen (such as 3200 x 1800, common on modern laptops), you will also get much better speed by reducing your display screen resolution to e.g. 1920 x 1080 before connecting. Already installed are: Matlab R2016a, ImageJ, and Imaris 8.4 and 9.0. Imaris 9.0 is only working on dnfvoltdatasrv1 (but there is a limit on UNIL licenses, so best to try in the morning before everyone arrives). If you do not get a license, you can also use 8.4 on dnfvoltdatasrv2 (license is always available for the moment) Try to avoid saving your documents to the local C: drive (i.e. your Desktop, My Documents, etc.). Please use NAS or your external drives instead. We only have 1 TB capacity for C: , so it will fill up fast. To attach an external USB drive, you will have to physically access the machine and plug your disk into one of the USB ports. When you are done, please \u201cSign out\u201d instead of disconnecting (see below how to do that). Since the RAM and video card are shared, please close the programs you do not use, particularly Imaris. One important trick is to minimize the Imaris windows if you leave them open for a long time: there is a bug where the video RAM will keep getting eaten up over time, leading to a crash, unless the window is minimized. You can view total RAM consumption through the Task manager, as well as check how much is in use by the other users (see below) To connect from home, use Pulse Secure first to get onto UNIL network. Please make sure your personal computer is virus-free. If you have old accounts on the dnfvoltdatasrv2 machine, these can still be used The machines will be restarted weekly on Saturday nice in order to install the updates (on Sunday 1 AM, actually). If this is not OK for you (running computations, etc), we can postpone the shutdown manually: just get in touch.","title":"Relevant points"},{"location":"servers.html#nas-storage","text":"The lab counts with various NAS that offers storage.

Gaussian_Filter5D A simple 5D Gaussian filter plugin for signal processing. This was currently missing from the default ImageJ tools, since the built-in 3D filter functionality does not fully support filtering higher-order stacks (such as combined z+t). The current plugin is natively capable of processing a 5-D stack, and is able to filter in all dimensions (except across channels). A DC offset option is provided to blank arbitrary noise values below a selectable threshold. MultiROI_TZ_profiler A multi-ROI trace plotter allowing for interactive, real-time exploration of the 5D data by the user. This expands the functionality of the built-in \u201cZ-axis profiler\u201d tool set up by the NIH developers (Baler and Rasband, 2003) which allows for plotting the average ROI signal through space or time. Using the Z-axis profiler code as a starting base, we added the multi-ROI (multi-trace) capability, as well as the capability of adding an externally loaded trace (e.g., an electrophysiology trace) to the plot. A number of other user-friendly options such as filtered trace overlay, color-coding and various display normalization options, are also provided via an extra interface window. The plugin implements dynamic update capability, allowing the user to move and modify ROIs, change channels and focal planes, and see the resulting trace changes in real time. Correlation_Calculator A cross-correlation plugin that performs a comprehensive list of voxel-by-voxel calculations through time in search of temporal correlation versus either an externally loaded trace, a binarized stimulus waveform, or an individual ROI extract. This allows for the easy identification of putatively time-locked regions within a 3D imaging volume. To improve the performance under the jittering response conditions, cumulative cross-correlation (area under the curve) is available in addition to the normal peak calculation. In our studies, we have applied this plugin to axonal stimulation paradigms (minimal stimulations) in the dentate gyrus and have thereby identified several regions within an astrocyte that reliably responded to the stimuli. Such regions corresponded to a fraction of <1% of the total analyzed astrocytic volume (Bindocci et al., 2017).

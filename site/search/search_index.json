Two of them are physically in the room and we count with a wireframe at UNIL computing facilities (NAS). To use the computer remotely go to \"How to conect?\" tutorial. Don't shut down the computer, disconect your session when your work is over dnfvoltdatasrv1.ad.unil.ch IP : 130.223.196.100 CPU : 48 Cores RAM : 512GB Graphic card : Radeon WX7100 Storage : 2TB SDD Software : Imaris 8.4.2/Imaris 9.1.2/Matlab R2015b-R2018/ImageJ Frequent users : Cedric, Iaroslav and Carlos Pending upgrades : 1TB RAM dnfvoltdatasrv2.ad.unil.ch IP : 130.223.196.101 CPU : 16 Cores RAM : 512GB Graphic card : Radeon WX7100 Storage : 2TB and: Iaroslav Disk 625GB Other Disk 600GB Software : Imaris 8.4.2/Matlab/ImageJ/LLastik/Blender Frequent users : Barbara and Iaroslav Pending upgrades : 1TB RAM Relevant points Do not shutdown these machines. Please do not restart these machines if other users are still connected, without asking! Volterra NAS can be accessed natively by mapping \\nas-fbm-av1.unil.ch\\AV_NAS_PRIVATE to a disk letter (e.g. Z: , see picture below). Use \\nas.unil.ch for the UNIL NAS. Use can also directly type these into the Explorer address bar. For fastest connection (especially from home), use the lowest color depth setting for Remote Desktop settings (High Color 15-bit setting). If you have a High-DPI screen (such as 3200 x 1800, common on modern laptops), you will also get much better speed by reducing your display screen resolution to e.g. 1920 x 1080 before connecting. Already installed are: Matlab R2016a, ImageJ, and Imaris 8.4 and 9.0. Imaris 9.0 is only working on dnfvoltdatasrv1 (but there is a limit on UNIL licenses, so best to try in the morning before everyone arrives). If you do not get a license, you can also use 8.4 on dnfvoltdatasrv2 (license is always available for the moment) Try to avoid saving your documents to the local C: drive (i.e. your Desktop, My Documents, etc.). Please use NAS or your external drives instead. We only have 1 TB capacity for C: , so it will fill up fast. To attach an external USB drive, you will have to physically access the machine and plug your disk into one of the USB ports. When you are done, please \u201cSign out\u201d instead of disconnecting (see below how to do that). Since the RAM and video card are shared, please close the programs you do not use, particularly Imaris. One important trick is to minimize the Imaris windows if you leave them open for a long time: there is a bug where the video RAM will keep getting eaten up over time, leading to a crash, unless the window is minimized. You can view total RAM consumption through the Task manager, as well as check how much is in use by the other users (see below) To connect from home, use Pulse Secure first to get onto UNIL network. Please make sure your personal computer is virus-free. If you have old accounts on the dnfvoltdatasrv2 machine, these can still be used The machines will be restarted weekly on Saturday nice in order to install the updates (on Sunday 1 AM, actually). If this is not OK for you (running computations, etc), we can postpone the shutdown manually: just get in touch. NAS storage The lab counts with various NAS that offers storage. If you want to connect you can access directly from the explorer adreess line or in mac from the finder > go to option. UNIL NAS This NAS belongs to university and every member of the lab has a folder that can use. To access to this NAS use this address: nas.unil.ch Volterra Lab NAS This NAS is for private use in the laboratory. Every member has a folder on it. 10 gigabits (1gb/user) RAID6 Secondary backup per day at 1am with backup explorer. In Sunday it does a parity check.

Iaroslav Image J Scripts Here will be information about the scripts that Iaroslav developed for ImageJ analysis. Documentation about this software could be found in the article: Studying Axon-Astrocyte Functional Interactions by 3D Two-Photon Ca2+ Imaging: A Practical Guide to Experiments and \u201cBig Data\u201d Analysis Batch-processing of acqusition stacks It creates a single file with all the .tif files. Gaussian_Filter5D A simple 5D Gaussian filter plugin for signal processing. This was currently missing from the default ImageJ tools, since the built-in 3D filter functionality does not fully support filtering higher-order stacks (such as combined z+t). The current plugin is natively capable of processing a 5-D stack, and is able to filter in all dimensions (except across channels). A DC offset option is provided to blank arbitrary noise values below a selectable threshold. MultiROI_TZ_profiler A multi-ROI trace plotter allowing for interactive, real-time exploration of the 5D data by the user. This expands the functionality of the built-in \u201cZ-axis profiler\u201d tool set up by the NIH developers (Baler and Rasband, 2003) which allows for plotting the average ROI signal through space or time. Using the Z-axis profiler code as a starting base, we added the multi-ROI (multi-trace) capability, as well as the capability of adding an externally loaded trace (e.g., an electrophysiology trace) to the plot. A number of other user-friendly options such as filtered trace overlay, color-coding and various display normalization options, are also provided via an extra interface window. The plugin implements dynamic update capability, allowing the user to move and modify ROIs, change channels and focal planes, and see the resulting trace changes in real time. Correlation_Calculator A cross-correlation plugin that performs a comprehensive list of voxel-by-voxel calculations through time in search of temporal correlation versus either an externally loaded trace, a binarized stimulus waveform, or an individual ROI extract. This allows for the easy identification of putatively time-locked regions within a 3D imaging volume. To improve the performance under the jittering response conditions, cumulative cross-correlation (area under the curve) is available in addition to the normal peak calculation. In our studies, we have applied this plugin to axonal stimulation paradigms (minimal stimulations) in the dentate gyrus and have thereby identified several regions within an astrocyte that reliably responded to the stimuli. Such regions corresponded to a fraction of <1% of the total analyzed astrocytic volume (Bindocci et al., 2017). Nicolas Matlab Scripts Here will be information about the scripts that Nicolas developed for Matlab Third parties Software Information about the software that we uses usually in the lab. Imaris We are using actually two versions of IMARIS: IMARIS 8: Belongs to the lab and is node-locked to dnfvoltdatasrv2 using a network card's MAC address as the key. It could be use only on that computer but if we talk to the company could be transfered to other one. (order ID: k7qy-mcsf-45gq-ed9p) IMARIS 9+: \u2060Using floating licenses belonging to DNF/UNIL. The availability of this licenses depends of the users number using at that time. This could be used in dnfvoltdatasv1 . Imaris License Manager Imaris 9+ node-locked license cannot be used on the machines with Remote-Desktop enabled (because multiple users can simultaneously run it remotely). This means that Imaris 8.4 is the latest version that we could use in dnfoltdatasrv2 with as many users as we need conected at the same time. To overcome this problem we bought Imaris License Manager which ca convert our single node-locked license to a floating license wich can be run on Remote Desktop for only one user.

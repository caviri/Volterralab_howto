# 3D automatic segmentation

## Vascular Data analysis

The analysis of this data require the identification and posterior segmentation of the blood vessels into Arterioles and Capilars. To achieve this a machine learning library based in Tensorflow is going to be tested: [Pointnet](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet/).
